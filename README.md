# Detection-of-Bicep-Form-Using-Myoware-and-Machine-Learning

This project helps people detect their muscle form during the bicep-curl exercises. We have used various technologies in this application to achieve the optimal solution. Myoware has played the dominant role, as it measures, filters, rectifies, and amplifies the electrical activity of a muscle and produces an analog output signal that can easily be read by a microcontroller, enabling novel, muscle-controlled interfaces for our project. Along with it, we have also used an accelerometer, as it is an electromechanical device that measures acceleration force, whether caused by gravity or motion. We have used Arduino for interfacing the sensors with Arduino nano and python for collecting data in real time from the sensors, into a csv file and creating a novel dataset. This dataset has been used to implement a machine learning model, for analyzing and making data-driven recommendations and decisions based on the input data. Last but not the least, we have used MIT App-Inventor for the User-end, for showcasing the performance of their workout session.

You are more than welcome to use this data for creating an ML/DL model or for any statistical analyses!
